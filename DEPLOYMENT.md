Save changes
Authorize Google Drive
Visit your deployed app
Click "Setup Google Drive"
Complete OAuth flow
Grant Drive permissions
Start Monitoring
Go to dashboard
Click "Start Monitoring"
Verify users are being checked
üîç Verification Steps
Check Deployment
bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-30T...",
  "monitoring_active": true,
  "active_recordings": 0
}
Test Recording
Add a username that frequently goes live
Wait for them to start streaming
Check dashboard for recording status
Verify file appears in Google Drive
Monitor Logs
Check Render logs for:

Successful startup
User monitoring activity
Recording events
Upload confirmations
üêõ Common Issues & Solutions
Issue: "Module not found" errors
Solution: Ensure all init.py files are present and src/ directory structure is correct

Issue: "Google credentials invalid"
Solution:

Verify credentials.json format
Check environment variable is set correctly
Ensure OAuth client is configured for web application
Issue: "Recording fails immediately"
Solution:

Check if user is actually live
Verify ffmpeg is available
Check network connectivity
Review TikTok rate limiting
Issue: "Drive upload fails"
Solution:

Re-authorize Google Drive access
Check Drive storage quota
Verify internet connectivity
Check file permissions
Issue: "App sleeps on Render free tier"
Solution:

This is normal behavior after 15 minutes of inactivity
App will wake up on next request
Consider upgrading to paid plan for 24/7 operation
üìä Monitoring & Maintenance
Health Monitoring
bash
# Check app status
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/status

# Monitor logs
# View in Render dashboard under "Logs" tab
Regular Maintenance
Check Google Drive storage usage
Review and update usernames list
Monitor Render resource usage
Check for failed recordings
Backup Configuration
Keep backup of credentials.json
Document environment variables
Save usernames.txt regularly
üîÑ Updates & Scaling
Updating Code
Push changes to GitHub
Render auto-deploys from main branch
Monitor deployment logs
Test functionality after deployment
Scaling Considerations
Free tier: 1 worker, limited resources
Paid tier: Multiple workers, more resources
Consider external worker processes for heavy recording
üìû Support
Debugging Steps
Check Render deployment logs
Verify environment variables
Test Google Drive connection
Check TikTok username validity
Monitor resource usage
Log Analysis
Key log messages to look for:

"Monitoring started" - System is active
"Found live stream for {username}" - Detection working
"Recording completed" - Successful recording
"Uploaded to Drive" - Backup successful
üéØ Production Tips
Resource Management: Clean up old recordings regularly
Error Handling: Monitor failed recordings and retry logic
